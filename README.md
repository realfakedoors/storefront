# storefront  

An example of React's simple & intuitive power in everyday front-end applications.  

Through efficient routing with react-router-dom, we can skip server calls and give our site a more 'app-like' feel. The result: a slick and intuitive storefront where shoppers can gracefully navigate to their own best experience.  

Final Project of the React Unit by The Odin Project.
